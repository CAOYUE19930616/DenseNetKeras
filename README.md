This is a work in progress, and is NOT complete. The model code may have errors. It is currently not the exact model that the paper implements, since I am experimenting with it right now.  Use at your own risk.

#Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet)
This repository contains the code for the paper [Densely Connected Convolutional Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993). Ported to Keras.

This code has been ported from the torch implementation found [here](https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet).
