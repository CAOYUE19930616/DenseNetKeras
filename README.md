#Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet)
This repository contains the code for the paper [Densely Connected Convolutional Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993). Ported to Keras.

This code has been ported from the torch implementation found [here](https://github.com/liuzhuang13/DenseNet).

#DISCLAIMER

This is a work in progress, and is NOT complete. Right now I only have code whch builds the model architecture. The model needs to be trained and tested to see if it matches the results of the papers. If you would like to help out with training and have GPUs available that would be speed up the process. Use at your own risk.

#TODO

 - Add code for training, data augmentation and results
